## Background

## Questions we will answer

## The Process

1.  Create a set of "cities" of varying sizes
2.  Use a gravity model to simulate transitions between "cities"
3.  User selects two transitions that they would make, one common and one uncommon
4.  The system visualizes these transitions when aggregated and under various layers of applied noise
